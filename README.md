### Quick starts

A small collection of simple build configurations. The motivation behind
this repository is to get a working JVM build going immediately
for a demo or scratchpad.

All builds use Gradle and include the wrapper, so the only
dependency is Java 8.

The Gradle build and wrapper in the root directory is to simplify building
in Travis.
